_Declarative visualization for Elm._

This package allows you to create data visualizations in Elm, following the Vega-Lite visualization schema.
It generates JSON _specifications_ that may be sent to the Vega-Lite runtime to create the output.

_If you wish to create Vega (as opposed to Vega-Lite) output, see the sister package [elm-vega](https://github.com/gicentre/elm-vega)._

## Example

A simple scatterplot encoding penguin morphology with position and species with colour:

```elm
let
    path =
        "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-datasets@2/data/"

    data =
        dataFromUrl (path ++ "penguins.json") []

    enc =
        encoding
            << position X [ pName "Beak Length (mm)", pQuant ]
            << position Y [ pName "Body Mass (g)", pQuant ]
            << color [ mName "Species" ]
in
toVegaLite [ data, enc [], circle [] ]
```

This generates a JSON specification that when sent to the Vega-Lite runtime produces the following output:

## Why elm-vegaLite?

### A rationale for Elm programmers

There is a demand for good visualization packages with Elm. There are certainly data visualization packages available, ranging from low level [SVG rendering](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/svg/latest/) through focussed charting packages (e.g. [line-charts](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/terezka/line-charts/latest/)) to a more [comprehensive visualization library](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gampleman/elm-visualization/latest). The designs of each reflects a trade-off between concise expression, generalisability and comprehensive functionality.

Despite the availability of these packages, there is a space for a higher level data visualization package (avoiding, for example the need for explicit construction of chart axes) but one that offers the expressivity to create a wide range data visualization types and styles. In particular, no existing libraries offer easy interaction and view composition (building 'dashboards' comprising many chart types). elm-vegaLite is designed to fill that gap.

**Characteristics of elm-vegaLite.**

- Built upon the widely used [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) specification that has an academic robustness and momentum behind its development. Vega-Lite is itself built upon the hugely influential [Grammar of Graphics](http://www.springer.com/gb/book/9780387245447).

- High-level declarative specification with best-practice defaults (a chart can be fully specified in as few as five lines of code).

- Strict typing and friendly error messages means "the compiler is your friend" when building and debugging complex visualizations.

- Flexible interaction for selecting, filtering and zooming built-in to the specification.

- Hierarchical view composition allows complex visualization dashboards to be built from trees of simpler views.

### A rationale for data visualizers

[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) hits the sweet spot of abstraction between lower-level specifications such as [D3](https://d3js.org) and higher level visualization software such as [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com). By using JSON to fully encode a visualization specification, Vega-Lite is portable across a range of platforms and sits well within the JavaScript / Web ecosystem. Yet JSON is really an interchange format rather than one suited directly for visualization design and construction.

By wrapping Vega-Lite within the Elm language, we can avoid working with JSON directly and instead take advantage of a typed functional programming environment for improved error support and customisation. This greatly improves reusability of code (for example, it is easy to create custom chart types such as box-and-whisker plots that can be used with a range of datasets) and integration with larger programming projects.

Elm and elm-vegaLite have been used successfully with hundreds of students to teach Data Visualization combining the beginner-friendly design of Elm with the robust and theoretically underpinned design of a grammar of graphics. It integrates well with [literate visualization](https://www.gicentre.net/litvis) to encourage good and reproducible practice in visualization design.
